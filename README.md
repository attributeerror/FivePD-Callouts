# FivePD-Callouts
This repository holds all of my FivePD callouts.
Each branch is for a different callout to ensure they all remain separated.
If you wish to download any of the callouts for your own use, you may do so by heading to the 'Releases' tab.

This branch is dedicated to the Abandoned Vehicle callout. You can browse the source code here, if you wish.

## Abandoned Vehicle Callout
Dispatch notifies you of a report of an abandoned vehicle. There are multiple scenarios available within this callout:
1. The vehicle has been abandoned for a couple of days, and no-one has been seen returning to the vehicle.
2. The vehicle has been involved in a front-end collision. Everyone involved fled the scene, and no-one saw the collision itself. Make sure there's nothing suspicious about the vehicle, and get it towed.
3. The vehicle has been involved in a rear-end collision. Everyone involved fled the scene, and no-one saw the collision itself. Make sure there's nothing suspicious about the vehicle, and get it towed.
4. The vehicle has been abandoned, but it looks as if it's broken down. The vehicle can't be moved, and could be blocked the road. Tow the vehicle, and notify its owner.
5. The vehicle has been abandoned but it appears that some of the tires has been slashed/deflated. This could be on purpose, or they could have a slow puncture, who knows?

### Planned Features
- Add the vehicle information to the police computer. (COMING SOON)
- Have the owner's information available in the police computer.
- Add suspicious items to the vehicle's inventory.
- Possibility of having injured/dead peds laying near the vehicle, or slumped over the steering wheel.
- Possibility of witnesses having seen the incident and helping you with your investigation.
