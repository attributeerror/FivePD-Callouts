# FivePD-Callouts
This repository holds all of my FivePD callouts.
Each branch is for a different callout to ensure they all remain separated.
If you wish to download any of the callouts for your own use, you may do so by heading to the 'Releases' tab.

This branch is dedicated to the Burglary callout. You can browse the source code here, if you wish.

## Burglary Callout
Dispatch notifies you of a report of someone attempting to break into a house. It's your job to respond to the scene and see if there really was a break-in, or if it's a hoax call or a paranoid neighbour! When you get on scene, you will be able to talk to the suspect and ask them some questions. There are multiple variations of the questions between yourself and the suspect, so you shouldn't get the same dialogue over and over again!

### Default Controls
- E - Talk to the subject.

### Planned Features
- Turn the dialogue into an interaction menu, allowing for more possibilites in the conversation.
- Chance that the suspect attacks you, depending on the weapon they possess.
- Chance that the suspect flees on foot, depending on where you take the conversation.
- Chance that the suspect calls for backup, and flees in a vehicle. This vehicle could also attempt to perform a drive-by as they speed off!
- Chance that the suspect is no longer in the area (gone on arrival).
- Chance that there will be people on scene that argue with you, or the suspect, or both.
